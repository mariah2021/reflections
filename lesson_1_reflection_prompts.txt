How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It became more clear and less time consuming

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If you were to review your work, as you should, it would make it quicker to realize a mistake, and this could make you a more efficient programmer. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    A con of manually choosing is that you do not save unnecessary data, and a pro is not having to worry about whether it saved or not. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think it is because it gives the coder a chance to efficiently save what they have created, for a computer. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    A git diff can be used to find the difference between two commits. A git log is used to view all changes made to a commit. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It makes me more confident because I can change things and know that if it goes wrong I can always have a starting line to where the code was correctly written. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Writing programs to use for projects.
